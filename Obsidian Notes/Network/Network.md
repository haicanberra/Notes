## Define
- Interested in the emergence of patterns in nature $\rightarrow$ why exist, how extract/observe patterns
- Compose of many elements that are interacting with each other - emphasize the importance of connections (Functional regions of brain/activated at the same time - Animal food chain/feeding on each other)

- Our life is completely defined by networks - Electronic devices connected to the web, our brain constantly using(?) network of information to process/make sense of information, human body is a network consisting organ/nervous system, in a city connected to numerous other cities of the same country/continent etc.  $\rightarrow$ deeper insight on interconnected nature of the world.
- A tool that can represent connections - each network can have different meaning in connections but same representation - ONLY CARE ABOUT CONNECTIVITY

- How related with data?: Flooded with data, 2 questions/challenges:
	- Computational challenges: Extract information from data $\rightarrow$ insight on how data is organized. Big but incomplete/biased/noisy $\rightarrow$ visualize and understand
	- Theoretical challenges: Building models that reproduce observed patterns and predict future ones
$\rightarrow$ Tools, data, model.
