### 6.1. Network and their representation.
- Vertices (Nodes) = n, Edges = m.
- *Multiedge*: More than one edge between same pair of vertices.
- *Self-edges / Self-loops*: Connect vertices to themselves.
- *Simple network/graph*: No multiedge / self-edges.
- *Multigraph*: With multiedges.
### 6.2. The adjacency matrix
- Self-edges counts as 2 in adjacency matrix.
### 6.3. 
- Weights in adjacency matrix are integers $\rightarrow$ multiedges network with same matrix exist (multiplicities of of the multiedges equal to corresponding weights).
